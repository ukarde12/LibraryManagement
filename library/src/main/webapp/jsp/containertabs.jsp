				<p>History (from Greek historia, meaning 'inquiry; knowledge
					acquired by investigation') is the study of the past. Events
					occurring before the invention of writing systems are considered
					prehistory. "History" is an umbrella term that relates to past
					events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization,
					presentation, and interpretation of information about these events.
					Scholars who focus on history are called historians.</p>

					written works. More restrictively, literature refers to writing
					considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have
					artistic or intellectual value,and sometimes deploys language in
					ways that differ from ordinary usage.</p>
